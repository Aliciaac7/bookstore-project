# DESCRIPTION:
This is a computer program that I created for a small bookstore. This application allows the manager of the store to manage inventory and rentals records efficiently.

# FEATURES:
- Display a list of all books in the store
- Search for a book by title and display its details
- Rent a book
- Display a list of all customers
- Search for a customer by name and display details
- Display a list of books rented by a particular customer

# IMPLEMENTATION:
- Implemented Java GUI using Swing
- Used txt files to input the data ( Books.txt, BooksRented.txt, Costumer.txt)
